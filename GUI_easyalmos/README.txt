easyALMOS: Graphical User Interface (GUI) of ALMOS
=======================================================

You need a terminal with Python to run easyALMOS, the GUI of ALMOS. This GUI simplifies the setup of ALMOS workflows, enabling users to select files, configure options, and launch clustering and active learning procedures without writing code. To run easyALMOS follow these steps:

1. Install ALMOS as described in the "Installation" section of our Read the Docs page:  
   https://almos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install/installation.html

⚠️ **Warning**: The GUI only works with ALMOS version 0.1.0 or later (check your version!).

2. Open an Anaconda prompt (Windows users) or a terminal (macOS and Linux).

3. Activate the conda environment where ALMOS is installed (e.g., 'conda activate almos').

4. Download 'easyalmos.py' (included in this repository or available in the 'GUI_easyalmos/' folder).

5. Go to the folder with the easyrob.py file (using the "cd" command, i.e. 'cd C:/Users/test_almos').

6. Run easyALMOS with the following command line ('python easyalmos.py').
